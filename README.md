## Hi there 👋

Hello! I'm **Vochant**, sometimes called **Mirekintoc** or **Mrkn**, a 15-year-old junior high school student from China and a participant in the **Olympiad in Informatics**. I mainly use **C/C++** for development, as this is also the most commonly used programming language for the Olympiad in Informatics. Perhaps this account, which has existed since I was in junior high school, will exist for a long time.
